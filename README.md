# code-detection-
When a secret code message is conveyed through a transmission channel, it is normally communicated as a series of bits, or 0s and 1s. The sent message may become garbled as a result of noise in the transmission channel. That is, the message received at the destination differs from the one sent; some bits may have been modified. The validity of the transmitted message at the destination can be checked using a variety of approaches. One strategy is to send the same message twice. Both versions of the message are compared bit by bit at the destination. The message received is error-free if the matching bits are the same.
